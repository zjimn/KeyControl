# KeyControl Software

[English Doc](README.md)
[中文文档](README_ZN.md)

This software is designed to help users control other windows using hotkeys, improving work efficiency and reducing interruptions during workflow.

## Overview

While using a computer, we often need to manage multiple windows simultaneously, such as watching videos or tutorials while taking notes on key information. This software provides a hotkey control feature that allows you to operate other windows without switching contexts.

## Features

- **Hotkey Control**: Easily control other windows with hotkeys without leaving your current working interface.
- **Window Selection**: Select the window you want to control from the list on the left side of the software.
- **Hotkey Configuration**: Customize your hotkeys for quick pause, play, rewind, or fast-forward of videos.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Open the Software**: After launching the software, select the window you want to control from the list on the left.
2. **Search for Windows**: Use the input box at the top to quickly find a window.
3. **Set Hotkeys**:
   - Click the red button that guides you to open the hotkey configuration window.
   - Define your hotkeys, such as setting the input hotkey to `Shift + Space` to control video playback.
   - Click save; the software will register the global hotkey with the system.
4. **Control the Window**: Press your defined hotkey in the working window to pause or play the video.

## Example Hotkey Settings

- `Shift + Space`: Play/Pause video
- `Shift + Q`: Rewind
- `Shift + W`: Forward
