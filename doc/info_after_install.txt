Installation is complete, and you can now start using the application. Here are some usage tips:

1. **Launch the Program**  
   You can start the application using the desktop shortcut or the app icon in the Start menu.

2. **Configure Settings**  
   After launching, you can configure the hotkeys through the settings dialog. In the hotkey input field, you can use multiple modifier keys (Shift, Ctrl, Alt) combined with a single key, or just one non-modifier key. There are no restrictions in the key mapping field.

3. **Use Features**  
   After selecting the window you want to operate on, click the start icon in the top right corner to activate the hotkey mapping feature. You can perform key mapping operations based on the set hotkeys. Click the stop button to halt hotkey mapping.

4. **More Operations**  
   Use the search box in the top left corner to find the desired window, and click the exit button in the bottom right corner to close the program.
